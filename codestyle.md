## Coding Style  

### HTML  

- Write all tags in lowercase.  
- Enclose attribute values in double quotes `""`.  
- Place each element on a new line for clarity.  
- Use concise comments in the format `<!-- Comment -->`.  

### CSS  

- Use lowercase for selectors, properties, and values.  
- Indent with 2 spaces.  
- Insert a blank line after each rule set for readability.  
- Place each property on a separate line.  
- Name CSS files with lowercase letters, using hyphens to separate words and ending in `.css`.  

### JavaScript  

- Indent using 2 spaces.  
- Use `const` and `let` for variable declarations; avoid `var`.  
- Separate functions with a blank line.  
- Prefer arrow functions for anonymous functions, e.g., `() => {}`.  
- Name JavaScript files with lowercase letters, separate words with hyphens, and end with `.js`.  

## File Naming  

- Use lowercase for all file names, separating words with hyphens `-`.  
- Name HTML files as `contacts.html`.  
- Name CSS files as `styles.css`.  
- Name JavaScript files as `script.js`.  

## Comments  

- Include necessary comments to clarify complex logic or methods.  
- Write comments in complete sentences for better understanding.  

## Additional Conventions  

- Enhance readability by avoiding overly complex nesting.  
- Limit each file to one main function or module to keep them manageable.
